Overview
========
There should be 3 main visual components; a main view, a sidebar to the right and a filter bottom bar.
All these should be persistant and only change contents. They should have their own APIs for easy manipulation.

Component: Sidebar
==================
The sidebar should display related data e.g. people in a picture, foto exif data, comments. It could possibly hold
controls for changing that data. Best would be to have tabs, one for related items, one for comments and one for
details.

Component: Filterbar
====================
The filterbar should have two views, one is for filtering control on tags, name etc, the other should display a
timeline where a range should be marked. This range should cover the times for the objects currently in view.
It could also be manipulated to only display a certain range of objects. The timeline should be "zoom":able
so it can cover second intervals to years.

Component: Main viewer
======================
This should also have tabs, one for a map view to display a location or a path if there are object like images
connected to a point then a marker should be placed there which should be clickable. Another view should be the
actual object, which could be an image or information about a person, this view should also hold a family tree
if such information is available. If a group of objects are selected, for instance when viewing an album, there 
should be a tab with all thumbnails.
