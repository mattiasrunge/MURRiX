          <h1>What is this?</h1>
          <p>
            This system tries to be a database over the things we record in our lives. It contains pictures, interviews, videos, written accounts of events as well as information about people, family ties, locations, things and much more.
          </p>

          <h2>Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Storing information in this system has a couple of benefits.
            <ul>
              <li>One is data security, all information is stored on hard drives with nightly backups to an offsite location.</li>
              <li>The second is that having all information in one place enables it to be organized in a more comprehensive maner e.g. links between things can be created, camera time synchronization offsets can be shared to get a better timestamp.</li>
              <li>The third us that everything is searchable and available to everyone we want. Photos are of no use when they just lie in a shoebox in the attic, they should be looked at and enjoyed!</li>
            </ul>
             Organizing the records of our lives makes the material more enjoyable but also keeps the coming generations from having to guess when a photo was taken, where a photo was taken and what a photo depicts. So even though it will require some manual work to add this extra information the benefits are hopefully worth it. The system will do as much as it can to automate this process from the information available.
          </p>

          <div class="alert">
            <strong>Heads up!</strong> One thing to think about is to never change the time of your camera, then an offset to a correct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC timestamp</a> can be stored in this system which will automatically synchronization all photos taken with that camera.

          <p>
            This sysem is called MURRiX and details about it can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/mattiasrunge/MURRiX">GitHub project</a>.

            <strong>Heads up!</strong> <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> is the recommended browser since it is the fastest available, functionality can not be guaranteed in any other browser even though <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> should work as well.

          <h1>How are things organized?</h1>
          <p>
            Any organization system requires classifying information in defined ways. This system relies on two top level classifications, nodes and items.

              <h2>Items</h2>
              <p>
                An item is an event defined in time and place. It could be a picture, a birthday or a diary entry for instance. Preferably every item has a time and place associated with it though in reality information might have been lost or is inaccurate, the key is to do best effort.

                  A position item is a simple location with an associated time. Positions like these can be connected to a node to represent where that node has been.

              <p>
                Nodes are a collection of items. A node is something real that can be touched, it could be a person, a location or a thing.

              <h2>Searching</h2>
              <p>
                Nodes can be found by searching for them by name. Searches can be filtered to only search for specific types of nodes. Tags can also be search for as described under the tags section. For convenience there is also a search field in the navigation bar at the top of the page. This search field gives instant results in a drop down.
              </p>
              <div class="alert">
                <strong>Heads up!</strong> In the future the search might be extended to search for other things but the names of nodes but for now it is important to use describing names and tags on nodes.

            <div class="span6">
              <h2>Tags</h2>
              <p>
                All nodes can be tagged. These tags can be used to group nodes in some manner. For instance a group of people which went to school together could be tagged with the school name or albums describing sailing vacations might all be tagged with sailing. The purpose of this is to make it easier to find the things you are looking for. The use and creation of new tags is strongly encouraged for all users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Searching for nodes with a specific tag can be done using the regular search function but with a query on the form of: tag=<em>tag name</em>, e.g. <a href="#search:tag=sailing">tag=sailing</a>.

              <p>
                In the browse section it is possible to find nodes which has items representing something that year. This means for instance that if a picture was taken 2010 the album that picture belongs to will show up when browsing 2010.
