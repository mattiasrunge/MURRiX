                  This system tries to be a database over the things we record in our lives. It contains pictures, interviews, videos, written accounts of events as well as information about people, family ties, locations, things and much more.
                </p>

                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>
                  Storing information in this system has a couple of benefits.
                  <ul>
                    <li>One is data security, all information is stored on hard drives with nightly backups to an offsite location.</li>
                    <li>The second is that having all information in one place enables it to be organized in a more comprehensive maner e.g. links between things can be created, camera time synchronization offsets can be shared to get a better timestamp.</li>
                    <li>The third us that everything is searchable and available to everyone we want. Photos are of no use when they just lie in a shoebox in the attic, they should be looked at and enjoyed!</li>
                  </ul>
                  Organizing the records of our lives makes the material more enjoyable but also keeps the coming generations from having to guess when a photo was taken, where a photo was taken and what a photo depicts. So even though it will require some manual work to add this extra information the benefits are hopefully worth it. The system will do as much as it can to automate this process from the information available.

                <p>
                  To keep things well organized and in order with a large amount of items it is important to have a common naming scheme. It will make it easier to find things as well as make it easier to know how to name stuff. A name should be descriptive but not contain any redundant information.

                  <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <strong>Rule!</strong> Keep names simple with no extra information like dates except for the reoccuring album rule below.
                  </div>
                </p>

                <h2>Reoccuring albums</h2>
                <p>
                  Sometimes there a photos taken every year at an yearly activity like a sailing vacation. To differentiate between different years, the year could be appended to the name of the album. In these cases append the year to the end of the name.

                  <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <strong>Rule!</strong> If album describes a yearly event, append the year to the end.

                </p>

                <h2>Persons</h2>
                <p>
                  Since there is a strong possiblity that two persons might have the same name, initials should be used to differentiate them. The initials should be placed between first and last name. If initials are known they should always be added.

                  <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <strong>Rule!</strong> If a persons initials are known always include them in the name between the first and last name.

                </p>

                <h2>Cameras</h2>
                <p>
                  The name of a camera should match the Camera model EXIF tag for images taken with that camera. This to make it easier for the system to suggest the correct camera for a file. Thus most cameras should be created from the links when setting camera for a file since it will fill in the name automatically.

                    <p>
                      Nodes can be found by searching for them by name. Searches can be filtered to only search for specific types of nodes. Tags can also be search for as described under the tags section. For convenience there is also a search field in the navigation bar at the top of the page. This search field gives instant results in a drop down.

                    <p>
                      All nodes can be tagged. These tags can be used to group nodes in some manner. For instance a group of people which went to school together could be tagged with the school name or albums describing sailing vacations might all be tagged with sailing. The purpose of this is to make it easier to find the things you are looking for. The use and creation of new tags is strongly encouraged for all users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Searching for nodes with a specific tag can be done using the regular search function but with a query on the form of: tag=<em>tag name</em>, e.g. <a href="#search:tag=sailing">tag=sailing</a>.
